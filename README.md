# doEach

This is a simple shell script that runs a command plus any options on each line in a file.

Came about from having a bunch of IPs I wanted to run a command on with the ability to provide command options.

Usage Example
-----
```./doEach.sh ping -c 3 targets.txt```

Not the coolest demo, but you get the point... :+1:
